        <span><p>What is ABD?  "ABD" is an abbrevation for "A Bizarre Day", a hit ROBLOX game based upon the manga "Jojo's Bizarre Adventure" by Hirohiko Araki.  This game immerses players in a world filled with unique and powerful entities called Stands, which grant their users extraordinary abilities.  The game features an open-world environment where players can explore different locations, interact with NPCs (Non-Playable Characters), and engage in combat with other players or enemies.  The game offers an intricate combat system that allows players to use their Stands' abilities in battles against others.</p>

       <p>The game appealed to thousands of players through its interesting combat system, paving way for a large portion of the player base in honing their skills to compete against eachother.  This game birth to a competitive scene within the game where ROBLOX users across the globe gathered in communinuties to battle eachother to see where they ranked among the best of the best.  The ABD competitive scene can be divided into 3 major eras: the Pre-gangs era, the Golden Age, and the Continuation.</p></span>

          <h2 class="pre-gangs-era">Pre-gangs Era</h2>
        </header>
        <span><p>The first era of competitive ABD is the Pre-gangs era.  This era signifies the time period before official staff-created gangs (official communities created for the ABD playerbase) were created.  During this time period, players created unofficial user-created clans that would compete and hold scrimmages against eachother.  A notable clan created at this time was Ultimus Asteri, created by ROBLOX user Xransot.  This clan would gain popularity holding popular ABD YouTubers Shade and RioDaBaller.  This reputation would eventually result in Xransot being known as the best ABD player amongst casuals who played the game. </p></span>

          </div>
        <span><p>The next major era of ABD competitive scene is the Golden Age.  This era is called the Golden Age because this is when ABD would peak out in popularity, reaching a peak at around 30k active players at once.  This would also be when the ABD developing team would decide to create staff-created gangs for the ABD community to join.  What differentiated official staff-created gangs and unofficial player-created clans was the pull of an official gang.  The allure of official gangs directly tied to the game itself created by the renowned game developers allowed for a far greater influx of players compared to player-created communities, which relied on outside popularity.  Some popular gangs include Plankstars, Sublime, Golden Brotherhood and The Tax Collectors.</p>
          
        <p>Gangs had ranking systems which were based on PVP skill in the game.  Tryouts were often hosted where you would compete against other players within your gang to rank up and gain a higher position.  Players who reached the highest rank within their gangs would be renowned as the best players within the PVP community.  The players who attained high level PVP roles in their respective gangs would compete against each other in official scrimmages against a different gang.  This is when the ABD comp scene peaked where an abundance of players would compete against each other within their gangs to attain the highest PVP roles and rank up, allowing for opportunities to participate in official scrimmages against other top players.</p></span>

</div>
        
        <span><p>The best PVP gangs during this time was Golden Brotherhood followed by The Tax Collectors.  Golden Brotherhood was a PVP orientated gang which only allowed players in if they won gang hosted tryouts.  This deviated from normal gangs which didn't have a requirement for membership.  This made Golden Brotherhood extremely PVP focused, attracting players that were serious about the game.  The official PVP team for this gang was called the Assault Team, hosting notable players such as krozus (the best player of this time period), Purifine, WO0OZEY, Asleepye, RoyalSR and many more.  Golden Brotherhood would have an official record of 35-1-1 in scrimmages.  The Tax Collectors was the gang where most members of Ultimus Asteri moved to.  Prior to gangs, Ultimus Asteri was the place that held the best ABD players.  This meant that The Tax Collectors held some of the best players at the time because of its ties to Ultimus Asteri.  Some UA (Ultimus Asteri) players that became Tax Collectors were Xransot, xSytherr, and DevilDestroyer096.  Although this gang held the players from UA, there were also top players who weren't tied to any major clans such as ClaidnixII, ShockReborn, and IIIDepIII. </p></span>

          <h2>The Continuation</h2>

</div>
        <span><p>The final and current era of ABD comp is the Continuation.  The reason why it's called the Continuation is because this is a time period of ABD after the game dies and loses almost all of it's playerbase (historically averaging roughly 100 players).  Due to irresponsible staff decisions, and the rise of another ROBLOX Jojo's game known as A Universal Time, the ABD player-base assimilated into other ROBLOX Jojo games such as Your Bizarre Adventure and the previously mentioned A Universal Time.  During this time, many of the ABD staff would leave ABD and disband their gangs until none of the gangs of the Golden Age remained.  The death of ABD would result in almost all of the ABD competitive scene to quit the game.  Although most of the top ABD players quit the game, some top level players still remained in the game and continued to hone their skills despite the absence of popularity.  Some of these players include wikisolo, WO0OZEY, ShockReborn, OilyDaniel, and crazyvillian.  This era is by far the longest era, the previous eras lasted in the span of months while the Continuation almost hits its 4th year.</p></span>

        <span><p>The top players who continued playing the game would eventually all acquaint themselves with eachother and compile into newly created staff gangs.  The primary gang everyone joined was Grand/Order (G/O), which would later be renamed to Crimson Flow (CF).  During this time, scrims were basically non-existant due to the game's low playerbase and the fact that all top players were saturated in one gang.  Although the game was dead, there were surprisingly new talents who joined the competitive scene that weren't heavily involved in the gangs of the Golden Age.  These players include fungusfern, coolElectriccharge, spxxsk, and Sparoux.  Players that joined the competitive scene during late G/O/early CF were called "newgens".</p></span>

          <h2>The Greatest Players of ABD</h2>
        </header> 
        <span><p>As you know, ABD is based off the manga "Jojo's Bizarre Adventure" and players of this game use Stands (special abilities in Jojo's Bizarre Adventure).  In addition to stands, there are also special abilities known as specs that were any ability that isn't a stand based ability.  Meta abilties are abilities that are the best abilities for PVP.  In order to play ABD at the highest level, top ABD players master meta abilities in order to maximize their potential. The meta abiltiies of ABD are Kars (Spec), Samurai (Spec), and Shadow The World (Stand).</p>

      <p>Kars in ABD is based upon the character "Kars" from "Jojo's Bizarre Adventure".  Kars in ABD is a meta ability because of its insanely high damage output, it's combo potential, high mobility, and versatility allowing for different kinds of playstyles.  Some of the greatest Kars players of all time include:</p></span>

      </ul>
      </div>
      <span><p>Samurai in ABD is a special ability that can be attained by completing the Samurai Quest where you have to deal 1,000 damage with No Abilities (Standless), 2,000 damage with Anubis (Stand), and 150,000 damage with Sword/Shiny Sword (Spec).  Samurai is a meta ability because of it's high walkspeed, and high mobility, allowing it to effectively travel across the map.  These strengths make up for it's weaknesses of having a low amount of moves comparative to the rest of the meta.  Some of the greatest Samurai players of all time include:</p></span>

      </div>
      <span><p>Finally, STW (Shadow The World) is a stand that is based off of Shadow Dio from the game "Heritage for the Future".  What makes this stand unique is that it has two movesets, it has a Stand Mode: On moveset where you can utilize the moves of the Stand "The World" and a Stand Mode: Off moveset where you can utilize the moves of the vampire Dio.  The best players use the two movesets in combination with eachother to maximize the use of the ability.  STW possesses extreme mobility, high versatility, great speed, and high combo potential.  Although STW has great strengths, some weaknesses include a low damage output and squishy health.  Some of the greatest STWs of all time include:</p></span>

          <h2>Who is the Best ABD Player?</h2>
        </header>
        <span><p>This section will go over the best ABD player across the three eras of ABD comp.  In the Pre-gangs era, the first best player of ABD was BonafideEnder (Ender).  Ender was an admin of the game who was the best player when ABD first gained a playerbase.  Ender was eventually dethroned by Xransot, the owner of Ultimus Asteri.  Xransot would feature himself in many RioDaBaller videos and Shade videos.  One of the videos he was in was "So I 1v1ed the best ABD Player" by Shade and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOCmtMxvIY0" id="best-abd-player-video">"1v1ing The Best A Bizarre Day Player!"</a> by Eshan Maurya (AKA DevilDestroyer096).  Xransot would be known as the best ABD player amongst the ABD community, but with the emergence of gangs, his title was lost.</p>

        <p>With the emergence of gangs, great players who would otherwise go unrecognized were able to make names of themselves within their gangs.  This raised the level of competition for the title of best ABD player where Xransot would get surpassed.  During the Golden Age, this is when when the level of competition was highest with dozens of great Kars users, STW users, and Samurai users.  In this time period, the best ABD player was krozus.  krozus was the first and best member of Golden Brotherhood's Assault Team.  In one of the scrimmages Golden Brotherhood had against the gang The Way of The Sword, a gang for Samurai users of ABD, krozus fought their best Samurai and 3-0'd him where he would gain the title of best Samurai in ABD.  krozus would later attend a scrimmage against The Tax Collectors where he would fight Xransot.  He dominated Xransot 3-1 who was believed to be the best player.  krozus also was the best player within Golden Brotherhood, which would hold the best players of ABD.  His resume of victories include Purifine (arguably the best STW at the time), FD_Ace (arguably the best STW at the time), Asleepye (arguably the best Kars at the time), Xransot (arguably the best Kars at the time), TACINSIGHT (the best samurai after krozus), RoyalSR (notable samurai), zicoari (notable STW) and many more.  With the death of ABD and the disbandonment of Golden Brotherhood, krozus would retire from the game on the top without anyone defeating him.</p>
        
        <p>After the death of ABD and the disbandonment of Golden Brotherhood, a new gang was created called The Fallen Kings.  Many of the remaining top players of ABD consolidated in The Fallen Kings.  Some of these players include Asleepye, WO0OZEY, wikisolo, ShockReborn, and OilyDaniel.  In The Fallen Kings, Asleepye was known as the best player defeating everyone in the gang.  Asleepye was also a top player in Golden Brotherhood who rivalled krozus at one point.  Some players Asleepye would defeat were the names listed above along with ClaidnixII and FD_Ace.  Despite this, his reign at the top was brief as he would be eventually usurped by wikisolo for the title of best player.  Asleepye and wikisolo trained together frequently.  At first Asleepye was better than wikisolo but overtime wikisolo adapted and grew where he would overtake Asleepye to begin his long reign as the best ABD player.  wikisolo has a reign of over 3 years as the best ABD player defeating every good player in the Continuation era.  He is widely recognized as the best ABD player amongst the PVP community with a stacked resume of defeating the likes of fungusfern (arguably the best STW of the time), WO0OZEY (arguably the best STW of the time), crazyvillian (the best Samurai of the time), spxxsk (the second best Kars behind wikisolo), coolElectriccharge (the best MIH (Stand)), tzuyinistah (an STW that cheated using a macro with autoaim), RoyalSR (a notable Samurai user) and more.</p>

        <p>So...who is definitively the best ABD player?  In terms of pure skill the answer is obvious looking at the experience gap between the three eras.  But in terms of accomplishments and greatness it becomes a toss up between wikisolo and krozus.  wikisolo has the edge in longevity and resume, but krozus has the advantage in level of competition (100 active players vs 30,000 active players).  Although wikisolo has defeated overall better players, the players of the Continuation era only surpassed the players of the Golden Age because the older players retired and got gapped in experience.  At equal experience levels the older players proved to be better than the players of the Continuation era.  If your criteria for best player is pure skill, longevity, and level of dominance then the best player would be wikisolo.  But if your criteria for best player is talent, skill, and achievements comparative to the time played and era then the best player would be krozus.</p></span>
